MS1:

Atticus: did serialization, value stack, table, and set value
Matt: did message, get value, incr value

Interesting elements: we noticed alot of the code/format for get value, set value, and to a lesser extent incr value
could be copied over and reused as how each process would occur on the outskirts of their actual functionality were 
very similar.
